WhatsApp Messenger is a freeware, cross-platform messaging and Voice over IP (VoIP) service owned by Facebook, Inc.[43] It allows users to send text messages and voice messages,[44] make voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other media.[45][46] WhatsApp's client application runs on mobile devices but is also accessible from desktop computers, as long as the user's mobile device remains connected to the Internet while they use the desktop app.[47] The service requires users to provide a standard cellular mobile number for registering with the service.[48] In January 2018, WhatsApp released a standalone business app targeted at small business owners, called WhatsApp Business, to allow companies to communicate with customers who use the standard WhatsApp client.[49][50]
The client application was created by WhatsApp Inc. of Mountain View, California, which was acquired by Facebook in February 2014 for approximately US$ 19.3 billion.[51][52] It became the world's most popular messaging application by 2015,[53][54] and has over 1.5 billion users worldwide as of February 2018.[55][53] It has become the primary means of electronic communication in multiple countries and locations, including Latin America, India, Pakistan's and large parts of Europe, including the United Kingdom, Spain, and France.</p><a href="#down">here</a>

WhatsApp was founded in 2009 by Brian Acton and Jan Koum, former employees of Yahoo!. After leaving Yahoo! in September 2007, they took some time off in South America.[10] At one point, they applied for jobs at Facebook but were rejected.[10]
In January 2009, after purchasing an iPhone and realizing the potential of the app industry on the App Store, Koum and Acton began visiting Koum's friend Alex Fishman in West San Jose to discuss a new type of messaging app that would "[show] statuses next to individual names of the people". They realized that to take the idea further, they'd need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum.
Koum named the app WhatsApp to sound like "what's up". On February 24, 2009, he incorporated WhatsApp Inc. in California. However, when early versions of WhatsApp kept crashing, Koum considered giving up and looking for a new job. Acton encouraged him to wait for a "few more months".On February 19, 2014, months after a venture capital financing round at a $1.5 billion valuation,[61] Facebook, Inc. announced it was acquiring WhatsApp for US$19 billion, its largest acquisition to date.[52] At the time, it was the largest acquisition of a venture-backed company in history.[51] Sequoia Capital received an approximate 5000% return on its initial investment.[62] Facebook, which was advised by Allen & Co, paid $4 billion in cash, $12 billion in Facebook shares, and (advised by Morgan Stanley) an additional $3 billion in restricted stock units granted to WhatsApp's founders Koum and Acton.[63] Employee stock was scheduled to vest over four years subsequent to closing.[52] Days after the announcement, WhatsApp users experienced a loss of service, leading to anger across social media.[64]

The acquisition caused a considerable number of users to try and/or move to other message services. Telegram claimed that it acquired 8 million new users;[65] and Line, 2 million.[66]

At a keynote presentation at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February 2014, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp was closely related to the Internet.org vision.[67][68] A TechCrunch article said this about Zuckerberg's vision:

    The idea, he said, is to develop a group of basic internet services that would be free of charge to use – 'a 911 for the internet.' These could be a social networking service like Facebook, a messaging service, maybe search and other things like weather. Providing a bundle of these free of charge to users will work like a gateway drug of sorts – users who may be able to afford data services and phones these days just don't see the point of why they would pay for those data services. This would give them some context for why they are important, and that will lead them to paying for more services like this – or so the hope goes.[67]

Just three days after announcing the Facebook purchase, Koum said they were working to introduce voice calls. He also said that new mobile phones would be sold in Germany with the WhatsApp brand, and that their ultimate goal was to be on all smartphones.[69]

In August 2014, WhatsApp was the most globally popular messaging app, with more than 600 million users.[70] By early January 2015, WhatsApp had 700 million monthly users and over 30 billion messages every day.[71] In April 2015, Forbes predicted that between 2012 and 2018, the telecommunications industry would lose $386 billion because of OTT services like WhatsApp and Skype.[72] That month, WhatsApp had over 800 million users.[73][74] By September 2015, it had grown to 900 million;[75] and by February 2016, one billion.[76]

In November 30, 2015, the Android WhatsApp client made links to another message service, Telegram, unclickable and uncopyable.[77][78][79] Multiple sources confirmed that it was intentional, not a bug,[79] and that it had been implemented when the Android source code that recognized Telegram URLs had been identified.[79] (The word "telegram" appeared in WhatsApp's code.[79]) Some considered it an anti-competitive measure,[77][78][79] but WhatsApp offered no explanation.
